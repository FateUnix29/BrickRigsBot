# BrickRigsBot

## Installation:

~~Run the setup.exe file in releases.~~ setup.exe has to be adjusted for the new codebase, courtesy of Copper (FateUnix29, @destiny_29)

Follow this tutorial down to step 7 of "Customizing and Authorizing bot": https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/discord-bot-in-python/

Copy the id of the channel you want bot commands to be sent to. Also, create a "Bot Admin" role and assign it to people you want to be able to use the bot.<br><br>

In order to use the bot, you must set an environment variable, either user or system, preferably named "DISCORD_TOKEN", with the value being your key in plain text.

To open environment variables, press the Windows key (note that I am using Windows 10 here) and search 'path' and click this:

Then, at the bottom, this button will open the environment variables window.

From there, locate this section:

Beneath it, press the first 'new' button:

And then...

Press OK, then press the other OK at the bottom of the environment variables window, and finally close out of 'System Properties' (the window opened when you typed in 'path').
From there, restart any terminal you had open, or any applications (such as VSCode) that contain an inbuilt terminal that can interface with the environment (such as VSCode's integrated terminal)
You should be good to go!<br><br>

The bot should be ready to run. Just run the application, be aware that commands sent will control your mouse and keyboard and the Brick Rigs game window must be open and in focus.

Join the discord here: https://discord.gg/pyDX9V5y8c. This is the discord for my battle server, will make a seperate one for questions about the bot in the future. For now, you can ask any questions you may have there.
