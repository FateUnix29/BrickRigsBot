# BrickRigsBot

## Installation:

Run the setup.exe file in releases.

Follow this tutorial down to step 7 of "Customizing and Authorizing bot": https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/discord-bot-in-python/

Copy the id of the channel you want bot commands to be sent to. Also, create a "Bot Admin" role and assign it to people you want to be able to use the bot.

Go to the folder that br-bot was installed to. Open the .env file in the _internal folder and paste your channel id, steam api key, and discord token into the respective fields in between the quotes.

The bot should be ready to run. Just run the application, be aware that commands sent will control your mouse and keyboard and the brick rigs game window must be open and in focus.

Join the discord here: https://discord.gg/pyDX9V5y8c. This is the discord for my battle server, will make a seperate one for questions about the bot in the future. For now, you can ask any questions you may have there.
